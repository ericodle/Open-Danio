## About this Project

*Danio rerio*, also known as the zebrafish, is a common model organism for its clear larval stage, high fecundity, and rich library of available mutants. 
While working with zebrafish for my master's project, I began writing simple scripts to interpret raw XY-coordinate outputs from open-souce object tracking software.

## Setup

Here is the recommended way to use this GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Open your computer's command line interface (terminal, control panel, etc.) and run this command.
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:ericodle/Open-Danio.git
  ```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project directory

  ```sh
  cd /path/of/project/directory
  ```
For example, the path was /home/ericodle/Open-Danio on my computer.
Therefore, I entered the command:

  ```sh
  cd /home/ericodle/Open-Danio
  ```
If performed correctly, your command line interface should change from:

```
(base) user@user:~$
```

to:

```
(base) user@user:~/Open-Danio$
```

Congratulations, we're in.

### Step 3: Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

### Step 3:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4:

### Step 5:

> __For this example, the working directory is the repository root directory.__ 

## Using the Open-Danio tools

### 2D_trajectory_analysis.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.

### 3D_trajectory_analysis.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.

### novel_tank_dive.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.


## Testing

Testing was performed on Intel and AMD systems running Linux kernel versions 5.14 and 5.15. 

explain the synthetic data scripts, and toss up the output images.
