    My colleagues and I aim to provide a transparent set of free-to-use tools for zebrafish behavior analysis. Similar commercially available software suites are restrictive, secretive, outdated, and unreasonably priced for the features offered.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this Project

Danio rerio, also known as the zebrafish, is a common model organism for its clear larval stage, high fecundity, and rich library of available mutants. While working with zebrafish for my master's project, I found conventional behavioral analysis tools lacking. To address this issue, I began writing simple scripts that interpret raw XY-coordinate output from excellent, open-source animal tracking projects such as [IdTrackerAI](https://gitlab.com/polavieja_lab/idtrackerai) and [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut). As my labmates and I learned more about Python programming, our modules became more ambitious. Though still in its infancy, we hope OpenDanio inspires you to contribute to our project, incorporate our tools, and take full control of your own data processing workflow! 

It's your data. You should decide what the computer does with it.
