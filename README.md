## About this Project

*Danio rerio*, also known as the zebrafish, is a common model organism for its clear larval stage, high fecundity, and rich library of available mutants. While working with zebrafish for my master's project, I began writing simple scripts that interpret raw XY-coordinate output from [IdTrackerAI](https://gitlab.com/polavieja_lab/idtrackerai).

## Setup

Here is my recommended way to use this GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Option 1 -- clone by terminal command

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:ericodle/Open-Danio.git
  ```

Option 2 -- clone by clicking

### Step 2: Change working directory into the project folder

  ```sh
  cd path/of/project/directory
  ```

### Step 3:
do venv

### Step 3:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4:

### Step 5:

> __For this example, the working directory is the repository root directory.__ 

## Using the Open-Danio tools

### 2D_trajectory_analysis.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.

### 3D_trajectory_analysis.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.

### novel_tank_dive.py

This script does xyz.

  ```sh
how to start it up
  ```

Then this will happen.

  ```sh
what to do next.
  ```

And this is the output.


## Testing

explain the synthetic data scripts, and toss up the output images.
