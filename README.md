This is a set of analysis tools to assist researchers working with zebrafish behavior.

My master’s project in neuroscience sparked an interest in coding that has been growing since early 2019. Tasked with identifying subtle behavioral changes due to drug treatment among mutant zebrafish while also working within tight budget constraints, I found myself turning to open-source software solutions for the first time. DeepLabCut and idtracker.ai, two cutting-edge pose estimation libraries, saved my thesis project and forced me to become proficient in Linux, Python, and artificial neural networks. I’ve been regretting not majoring in Computer Science ever since.

In this repository, you will find python scripts for 2D trajectory plotting, novel tank dive analysis, and a shoal cohesion calculator. With a focus on leaving clear, understandable comments inside the code, I tried to make the inner workings both transparent and easy to pick up for python beginners. Hopefully, researchers not only find these tools useful, but contribute ideas and improvements of their own.
